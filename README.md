## cargo crev reviews and advisory

It is recommended to always use [cargo-crev](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev)  
to verify the trustworthiness of each of your dependencies.  
Please, spread this info.  
On the web use this url to read crate reviews. Example:  
<https://web.crev.dev/rust-reviews/crate/num-traits/>  

## Cargo make

I prepared some flows and tasks for Cargo make for the workspace.  
`cargo make` - lists the possible available/public flows/tasks  
`cargo make release` - builds the release version and runs the server and the browser  
`cargo make doc` - copies readme.md into lib.rs doc-comments, build the `/target/doc` folder and copy to the `/docs` folder  
`cargo make publish` - publish the webfolder to google vm
